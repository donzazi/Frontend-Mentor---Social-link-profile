# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I experiemented with padding and margin and after many tries I somehow got it right.
I learned how to make a backround-color transparent so that I can individuelly set the color.
I learned a little about flex, direction, center and column.
I learned to make hover-effects.

### Continued development

I want to become better at styling my HTML code. First I need to be better at Semantic-HTML and how everything is built and can be nested. So far I have not used any links or anchor tags, so I will
focus on that more. The css is very important for me even though chatgpt can make it for me, but I want to be able to make everything fluidtly.
